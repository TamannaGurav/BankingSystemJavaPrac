# BankingSystemJavaPrac
A basic console-based banking system implemented in Java.  
This project is created purely for **practice purposes** and focuses on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts like **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **method overriding**.

## Features Implemented
- Account creation (Savings & Current)
- Deposit and withdrawal operations
- Daily withdrawal limits (Current Account)
- Monthly withdrawal limits (Savings Account)
- Timestamp logging for transactions
- Basic transaction rules and fee handling

## Purpose
This project is meant to:
- Practice Java fundamentals and OOP principles
- Improve logic building and code structure

## ðŸ’¡ Suggestions Welcome
This is a learning project â€” any feedback, code reviews, or improvement suggestions are appreciated to help me write cleaner and more efficient code.

## ðŸ“Œ Note
- This is **not a production-grade application**
- No persistent storage (like databases) is used â€” everything runs in memory via the console
